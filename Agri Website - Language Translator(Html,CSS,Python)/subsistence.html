            <h4 style="font-size: 21px; color:rgb(15, 162, 15); font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif" >Subsistence farming was the first type of agriculture seen in early civilization, developed over 12,000 years ago. Archeological evidence points to grains being some of the first subsistence crops farmed and cultivated by people. Before subsistence farming, around 95% of humans sustained themselves by hunting and gathering, which required communities to move frequently to find food. Subsistence agriculture enabled small groups to provide for their basic needs without the need for a nomadic existence, consisting of moving long distances in order to find resources. The Neolithic Revolution, as coined by anthropologist V. Gordon Childe, was the evolution of society from hunter and gatherer to an agriculturally based lifestyle.

                According to Childe, this Neolithic Revolution quickly developed due to the advent of metallurgy. Using metals for farming tools not only changed the diets of people in the past, but their culture as well. With the ability to cultivate land and produce crops to support entire communities with relative ease, groups were able to remain in one location for longer periods of time. Those not directly responsible for farming were able to specialize in other trades. This societal change enabled the growth of cities, supporting larger populations. Gradually, subsistence farming developed into large scale agricultural production, focusing on a few crops to meet the needs of the many rather than the diverse needs of a tiny community.</h4>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:rgb(15, 162, 15); font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif"> In subsistence farming, fields are often a mix of crop groups. Polyculture, or mixed cropping, allows for many crops to be planted together in complimentary groups. Planting certain crops together helps to replicate a natural ecosystem and improves the quality of the soil. Crop mixing also reduces the number of insects and pests, as some plants have naturally repellant properties that can help protect the surrounding vegetation.

                One commonly found polyculture group is maize, beans, and squash. Planting this trio together increases the harvests by a significant amount, without stripping nitrogen and other nutrients fully from the soil. Dense crop mixing has the added benefit of reducing the number of weeds and other unwanted flora from growing in the fields.</p>
