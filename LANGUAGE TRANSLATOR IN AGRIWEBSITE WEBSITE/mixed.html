Such agriculture occurs across Asia and in countries such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Afghanistan, South Africa, China, Central Europe, Canada, and Russia. Though at first it mainly served domestic consumption, countries such as the United States and Japan now use it for commercial purposes.[citation needed]

                The cultivation of crops alongside the rearing of animals for meat or eggs or milk defines mixed farming.For example, a mixed farm may grow cereal crops such as wheat or rye and also keep cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry. Often the dung from the cattle serves to fertilize the cereal crops. Also some of the crops grown, might be used as fodder for the livestock. Before horses were commonly used for haulage, many young male cattle on such farms were often not butchered as surplus for meat but castrated and used as bullocks to haul the cart and the plough.</h4>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:rgb(15, 162, 15); font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif"> The main characteristics of the mixed farming are that farms pro­duce both crops and livestock and the two enterprises are interwoven and integrated. The grass is an important crop of mixed farming sys­tem, occupying at least 20 per cent of the cultivated land. In the mari­time regions (Wales) grasses occupy up to 75 per cent of the cropped area. The grass is treated with as much care as a cereal or cash crop.

The application of fertilizer per hectare of arable land in mixed farm­ing in Northwestern Europe is higher to that of any other part of the world except Japan. Further, many farms, particularly in Britain and the Netherlands, purchase grains and concentrate to feed their live­stock. Moreover, in mixed farming, a number of crops are grown. Cereals dominate the crop land use, the leading grain varying with climate and soil.</p>
