            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:rgb(15, 162, 15); font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif"> In this, farmers grow crops to trade. It is also called agribusiness, where farmers raise crops or livestock to make a profit by selling them. 
                Following this, farmers have to invest massive capital in this farming. Usually, the farmers increase their farm productivity in this farming by high doses of manure or other modern inputs, including fertilisers, high yielding variety seeds, insecticides, pesticides and many more. 
                In commercial agriculture, farmworkers have to use many modern technologies to increase farm productivity. They primarily grow the cash crops and cereals in this farming.Like we mentioned earlier, commercial agriculture provides raw materials to industries, and some of the output is exported to other countries. This means production needs to take place at a large scale so that the production can cater to the growing demand.From a vast expanse of land for production to the most efficient and modern machinery, all the inputs required by an agribusiness require a huge amount of capital investment. 

                Plus, large-scale production also requires more labor. This means, to egt the farm up and running, funding is vital. </p>
